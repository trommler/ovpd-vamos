Case recursively foreign key relation

In this case we want to show how the VPD work with entities which stand in recursively foreign key relations.
That means we have a entity A,B,C and the primary Key from A is the foreign key in B and the Primary keys from A and B are the forgein keys in C and so on. In the Figur below you can see a generated example called bank customer.
There the entities "bank customer", "bank account" and "transaction". The entity "bank customer" have the primary key "costumer number" which is the foreign key in entity "bank account", the "IBAN" is the primary key in entity "bank account" and the foreign key in "transaction". It is possible to expand the example with the other side of the transaction, like double entry, but this is not so importent for the clearness.

Case record does not exist

In the case we won`t give access to data if an entry in the database does not exist, we have to check it before the system answer the query. To demonstrate the use case we look on the case study from VAMOS ( DB Acesscontroll, trommler, 2011). On the figure ERD-Vamos we can see, that only relatives which have an special entry in the DB, can see the health status form the VAMOS Customer.
